Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
     An inline element only takes up as much width as is needed to display the contents of the element which allows other elements to be in line with the inline element. A block element takes up the full width available on a web page which blocks out any other elements from sitting next to it on the left or right.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    That means the element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor but if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    By using Flexbox, you're able to write the right code to make this work
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Display block elements: p,h,section
    Display inline elements: span, nav
    Display inline-block element: img
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model allows us to add space around elements. By using the box-sizing property, we can include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
